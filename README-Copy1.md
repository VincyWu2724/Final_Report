# Final Report

## Question
- The scientific question I plan to investigate is: What is the relationship between wetland distribution, green infrastructure, and land surface temperature in New York City? The hypothesis is that wetlands and green infrastructure significantly contribute to mitigating urban heat by lowering daytime and nighttime surface temperatures. By analyzing spatial and temperature data, this study aims to quantify the cooling effects of these natural and designed urban features.

## Summary of the Analysis
1. Evaluate the relationship between wetlands, green infrastructure, and land surface temperature in New York City.
2. Combine spatial data on wetland and green infrastructure distribution with temperature data.
3. Correlation and visualization techniques will be employed to identify patterns and assess the cooling effects of these urban features.
